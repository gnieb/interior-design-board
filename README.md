TO DO
- add another modal to ask about adding from library
- password length validation
- the pieces currently cannot belong to more than one design -> this will work hopefully when 
    - backup for this is to load up the seed file!!!!!!
- uploads
- push the user to the new design they made after they create it???

NEW DESIGN - 
- add the collection picture with the modal 
- add to the collection from LIBRARY??



REACT DND:

- Wrapped App with DND Provider - may need to move that piece around to wrap more or less things. 
- gave DND provider a backend property.... make sure that works with my backend??
